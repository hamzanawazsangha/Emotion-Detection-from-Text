![Project Banner](https://via.placeholder.com/800x300?text=Emotion-Aware+Chatbot+for+Mental+Health+Support)

## 🌟 Introduction

In today's digital age, many individuals lack immediate access to mental health support. Our Emotion-Aware Chatbot bridges this gap by analyzing textual input to detect emotional states and respond with empathy, offering preliminary mental well-being support.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Detect emotional states from text input with high accuracy
- Provide empathetic, context-aware responses
- Offer immediate mental health support
- Reduce barriers to accessing emotional support

## 🚀 Key Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Real-time Emotion Detection** | Identifies 5 core emotions: anger, fear, joy, love, sadness |
| **Contextual Responses** | Delivers tailored empathetic responses for each emotion |
| **High Accuracy Model** | 93.8% accurate emotion classification (F1-score: 0.938) |
| **Privacy-Focused** | No data storage or logging of sensitive conversations |

## 📊 Model Performance

Our fine-tuned BERT model demonstrates exceptional performance:

| Metric | Score |
|--------|-------|
| Accuracy | 93.8% |
| F1-Score | 0.938 |
| Precision | 0.938 |
| Recall | 0.938 |
| Inference Speed | 179.84 samples/sec |
